= Activity - Identify Network Connections from Malware

== Scenario

An unsuspecting user downloaded and ran an unknown application and you suspect it may communicate over the network. You want to analyze this application and assess its network activity.

== Exercise

Download `bad2.exe` from the OpenStack web server. Run `bad2.exe` and leave the window open. Identify what `bad2.exe` does using Windows network utilities or SysInternals tools.

_Note:_ This “malware” is not actually malicious and can be run on any system with access to the internet.

== Deliverables

A document in DOC, DOCX, or PDF format recording your process and the results of your analysis.  Name document with lastname, ie. 'Beckman_analysis.doc'

List all applicable IP addresses and ports, in addition to any DNS names found.

.*DOCUMENT MUST BE IN DOC, DOCX, or PDF FORMAT*
.*DO NOT ZIP DOCUMENT BEFORE UPLOADING TO BLACKBOARD*


== Grading

I am undcertain if we should make this a graded exercise or not. The grading standard seems too fuzzy.

* 70% - Identify general concept idea of malware activity
* +10% - Well documented and formatted report
* +10% - Fully identify all network activity over time
* +10% - Analysis of malware using Sysinternals suite applications

== Learning Objectives / Outcomes

* Application of Windows networking utilities
* Analyzing network connections
* Understanding connection states
* Assessing application activity over time
* Familiarity with Sysinternals suite networking tools
