== Activity

Write a PowerShell script that enumerates all Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) loaded into processes.
Output a clearly formatted and annotated list by process of every DLL loaded into each process:

=== Task 1)
Get the list of running processes.

=== Task 2)
Iterate over the list of processes.

For each process:
* Output the process name
* Output the list of DLLs (modules) loaded into each process

=== Task 3)
Output a unique list of all DLLs loaded into every process.  If, for example, system32.dll is loaded into 30 processes, it appears only once in this list.
