Write a PowerShell script that enumerates all Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) loaded into processes.
Output a clearly formatted and annotated list by process of every DLL loaded into each process:

[square]
* Get the list of processes
* Iterate over the list of processes
** Output the process name
** Output the list of DLLs (modules) loaded into each process

Output a unique list of all DLLs loaded into every process. If system32.dll is loaded into 30 processes, it appears only once in this list.

== Deliverables

[square]
* A script that lists DLLs loaded into each process, and its output
* A script that lists unique DLLs loaded into every process, and its output

== Learning Objectives / Outcomes

[square]
* Familiarity with PowerShell objects, properties, and variables
* Understanding and manipulating arrays
* Familiarity with the ForEach-Object cmdlet and iterating over arrays
* Confidence writing scripts to achieve specified objectives
