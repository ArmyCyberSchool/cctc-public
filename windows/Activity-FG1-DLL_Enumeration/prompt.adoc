= Activity - DLL Enumeration

== Learning Objectives

* CCWI000 - 
** CCWI000.000 - 

== Learning Outcomes

* Familiarity with Batch commands, properties, and variables
* Understanding and manipulating Batch variables
* Familiarity with the For loop
* Confidence writing scripts to achieve specified objectives

== Scenario

* N/A

=== Task 1)

* Write a Batch script that enumerates all Dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) loaded into processes.
Output a clearly formatted and annotated list by process of every DLL loaded into each process:

** Get the list of processes
** Iterate over the list of processes

*** Output the process name
*** Output the list of DLLs (modules) loaded into each process

* Output a unique list of all DLLs loaded into every process. If system32.dll is loaded into 30 processes, it appears only once in this list.

== Deliverables

* A script that lists DLLs loaded into each process, and its output
* A script that lists unique DLLs loaded into every process, and its output
