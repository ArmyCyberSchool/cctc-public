== Scenario

You are implementing a new security logging policy. You want to run a logging script that tracks the number of system reboots and logs reboots automatically to a file. Additionally, you want to run a script generates a log every time users log into the system.

Create a PowerShell script that adds the appropriate registry keys to run the appropriate scripts when the system is launched and when users log on.

Create a PowerShell script that is run when the system is launched. This script will store the number of reboots in a registry entry and increment that number. The script should also log the system date and time and number of reboots to a file. The log file should be appended with every reboot, not overwritten.

Create a PowerShell script that is run when a user logs on. This script should log the system date and time that a user logged in to the same log file.
