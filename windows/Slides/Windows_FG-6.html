This step happens before an incident occurs. Ensure you have the appropriate response plans, policies, call trees and other documents in place and that you have identified and trained the members of your incident response team, including external entities. Ensure that tools and procedures for incident response have been selected and documented. Ideas:
Have a packing list for every team member so everyone brings everything they need. (Don’t want to not have to call back or make impact purchases while on a IR mission.)
Ensure all tools are updated (don’t want to show up to a site and have to update your tools on a compromised network)
Training (team members know what tools they use and their job roles)
Documentation (Team knows the TTPs that they will be using during the IR)
Standard Operating Procedures (review SOPs that you will use while on an incident)
Network Diagrams (if you are able to get Network Diagrams from the sites you might go to.)
Policies & Procedures (Know these of places that you may go to)
What are some external entities that might be part of an incident response team (S-6, S-3, SJA, CI, etc.)
One important preparation item is to enable NTP or another method to keep host clocks synchronized, so that events can be correlated, and forensic analysis uses a consistent time.

Indicators of Compromise
Vulnerability Assessment
Forensic Analysis (Static & Dynamic)[4]
Static Analysis - Static analysis examines malware without actually running it.
Strings - Seeing what DLLs, functions, headers might be revealed in the strings output.
OSINT (Open Source Research), Hash the file and check the hash to see if there is anything online about it.
Running the binary through antivirus tools to verify maliciousness
Disassemble the binary using a tool such as IDA (Pro)
Dynamic Analysis - Watching the malware while it is running
Typically takes place after static analysis techniques have been exhausted
Binary is run using a sandbox that records all activity and changes caused by the malware
Monitor all activity using ProcMon, Task Manager, Procexep
Look for network traffic using TCPView and Wireshark, fake responses using a tool like Fakenet
Check for registry and file changes with tools like RegShot and sigcheck
View the programs execution in a debugger such as Ollydbg or WinDbg

Volatility is a measure of how perishable electronically stored data is (when electrical power is turned off or fails). [3]
Order of volatility is important when making decisions about how to respond to a potentially compromised system. A system shutdown is sometimes the worst option forensically, since it may mean the loss of transient (volatile) data held in RAM. Understanding what data is lost at a system shutdown, and what data is lost when drives are replaced or reformatted, will help guide the steps taken to forensically investigate a potentially compromised device.
Beginning with the most volatile[5]:
registers, cache
routing table, arp cache, process table, kernel statistics, memory
temporary file systems
disk and other storage media
remote logging and monitoring data that is relevant to the system in question
physical configuration, network topology
archival media

Research and develop a short brief for the class, explaining the difference between a baseline and an enumeration.
Items for discussion:
Is there any difference between baselining a server or a user workstation? (Yes, often servers are more locked down than workstations, and user definable options, processes, and software will change less frequently.)
How often should you baseline? (Whenever configuration changes that affect the baseline are made to the system. In a mature IT organization, this will be coordinated through a configuration management process.)
Does it make sense to baseline the entire registry? (No, parts of the registry are dynamic.)
Are there other things you could baseline?
In this class, we’re talking about baselining in the sense of taking a static baseline - a snapshot of a system at a point in time. It can also make sense to do dynamic baselining - that is, gathering more dynamic, less predictable, performance data (number of network connections, amount of memory or network IO by process, etc.) at regular, frequent points in time. This allows system administrators and information security professionals to look at trend data both to help predict future system requirements (in terms of memory, CPU, or network bandwidth, for example)  and to detect anomalies (for example, a system that suddenly has a discontinuous jump in network IO) that may indicate the presence of malware.
Static baselines are deterministic - if, for example, in a mature IT organization, a new local user account has been added without going through the configuration management process (which should, in turn, trigger an update to the baseline), either a security policy has been violated or a system has been compromised.
Dynamic baselines are based on trend analysis, and are probabilistic. A sudden uptick in network traffic may indicate a compromise, or it may simply indicate a new or increased mission requirement for that system.

How and when to baseline a system should be part of an incident response SOP. A baseline should be taken from a known clean state, usually before the computer is connected to the internet (unless intranet patching servers are not available - e.g. WSUS.) Some items of baseline knowledge to consider capturing include:
 Local User Accounts
 Running Processes
 Services (installed and autostart)
 Autorun locations (startup folder, registry locations (Run, RunOnce, Explorer shell extensions)
 Scheduled tasks
 Drivers and system files (file hash)
 Network communications (established and listening. Also, is there a configured IPv6 connection on an IPv4 network or vice versa.)
 Loaded modules (DLLs)
 Installed applications and user context (who’s running with elevated privileges?)
 Group policy objects

Based on the lessons covering skills 1-4, discuss some ways to use native Windows and SystInternals to gain awareness. These might include command line tools, powershell cmdlets, CIM/WMI and Sysinternals. Have students identify the which tools they’ve learned earlier that could be included in a baseline.

Normal activity is a system that operates within security policies and in the way that it was intended. For example, a workstation connection to services for valid operational purposes. To understand normal behavior requires observing the network and the systems on it over time, so that deviations from routine use can be detected and investigated.

Remind students that while we’re focusing on the operating system here, most compromises happen at the application level, especially initially. Understanding of normal behavior must include understanding how applications, especially public facing applications (web apps and services) behave.

Other malicious activity is harder to detect - especially if an adversary has simply gained persistent access and is waiting for an operational trigger to do anything else.  Sometimes months go by between a compromise and malicious activities. There are some atypical behaviors which tend to indicate malicious activity - for example, a workstation does not normally connect to other workstations, a web server does not typically initiate connections, but often compromise can be a subtle as a single change to a configuration file.

31.5 Identify scheduled tasks that may affect the purpose or activity on a machine
</section><section data-background="https://git.cybbh.space/CCTC/public/raw/master/networking/slides/resources/cybbh-skule_header.png" data-background-repeat="none" data-background-position="left top" data-background-size="100%">
Review work done in earlier modules to enumerate scheduled tasks. A scheduled task may be used to launch malicious activity, or to maintain persistence on a compromised system. This can have advantages over a resident exploit, since a scheduled task can carry out a malicious function (for example, exfiltrating data or listening for further commands from a command and control server) then remove itself from memory until the next scheduled iteration.
Note that an attacker may exploit an existing scheduled task instead of adding one to the scheduled task lists, for example, by changing a configuration file or script to launch an additional process. How could this be mitigated? (Configuration files for processes that run with elevated privileges, or scripts that run with elevated privileges, should be part of the system baseline, and access to them should be controlled through ACLs.)
 Identify scheduled tasks that may affect the purpose or activity on a machine
31.5 Identify scheduled tasks that may affect the purpose or activity on a machine

This depends on the purpose of the enumeration. Reference the discussion of a baseline above, and have the students discuss what questions they would want to answer from their forensic examination of a possibly compromised system (who, what, where, when, why, how):
Who is behind the attack / where did it originate? (IP addresses for scans, malicious access - can we isolate the attack to an organization, a region, or even a pattern of jump boxes? Is the malware used or the style of attack associated with a particular threat actor?)
What did the attacker do on the compromised system? Is there evidence that other systems are also compromised (active tunnels, logged connections, listeners)?
When did the attacker gain access (this may require examination of log files that have previously been consolidated off of the compromised system, backups of the compromised system (protip: full system backups can be used to develop file hashes for comparison even if you failed to baseline them before), file timestamps, etc. - remember that you cannot necessarily believe the timestamp of any artifact on a compromised system.)
How did the attacker gain access? What vulnerability (ies) did they exploit? What exploit(s) did they use? Are there other systems on the network vulnerable to the same attack? What remediation steps need to be taken to protect other systems?
Why did the attacker choose this system? What is he trying to accomplish? Is he using this box for access (pivoting?) pr discovery (scanning?) Does it contain sensitive data, or does it have an account with access to sensitive data on a share or database? Does it have access to the public internet for phishing, spamming, or scanning / DoS?
Based on those questions, students should discuss using a systematic, iterative process to approach enumerating a suspected system.
Design initial forensic hypothesis based on SOPs and suspect system behavior.
Design system enumeration to confirm or deny the hypothesis and provide supporting information
Analyze the results of the enumeration
Based on those results, refine or reformulate the hypothesis, or expand the search and start over.
 Identify scheduled tasks that may affect the purpose or activity on a machine
31.6 Explain what should be assessed during enumeration of the environment.

Some ways to detect and enumerate malware include:
Comparison with a known good baseline.
Look for anomalous behavior on a system, or anomalous interactions with other systems on the network.
Scanning for vulnerabilities to identify potential malware
Anti-malware scanners (for example, anti-virus software) - these are either signature based or heuristic. Signature based scanners use signature files to compare software on the system with list of known malicious code. Heuristic scanners look for behaviors associated with malicious activity. Most current scanners use a combination of signature based and heuristic detection. Malware developers often obfuscate their code, and code in extraneous behaviors to confuse both signature based and heuristic scanners.
Look for unexpected activity in log files. Since malware and malicious actors often attempt to groom log files, look for inconsistencies between log files (obviously missing entries, timestamp inconsistencies, differences between events logged at application and OS level, etc.)
Sandboxing - observing the behavior of the compromised system in a controlled environment, without connection to the rest of the network (note that sophisticated malware may attempt to connect to a specific IP address or use a specific service, such as DNS, to check for being sandboxed. A good sandbox environment needs to provide duplicate services to fool malware into thinking that it’s running on an open network. Virtualization is your friend here.
Packet sniffing to collect additional data on malware behavior. This can be used in conjunction with sandboxing.
Event correlation - try to correlate events on the compromised system with other events on the network. For example, a failed login attempt captured in an application log may be correlated with a specific IP captured in a firewall log.

What is reporting?
Reporting is giving the appropriate and necessary information to enable the leaders of the owning organization to make decisions.
Reporting can take different forms depending upon your mission set and your team.
In a report, there are usually multiple sections, each designed for a specific audience.  What are the sections and who is the audience for each?
The report will usually begin with an executive summary written for higher level, less technical leaders.  It is the 10,000 foot overview of the five W’s – who, what, where, when and why. The executive summary will usually outline the courses of action (COA) but it is not the location for the detail of each COA.
The body of the report is designed and written for the primary audience of individuals who have to make solid decisions
What are some of the components of a report?
With every report, you will need to provide mainly the five W’s — who, what, where, when and why that is written in an executive summary. The executive summary will outline COAs and provide a brief description of why each COA is recommended (or not recommended).
The body of the report is designed and written primarily for individuals who have to make solid decisions about how to operate in cyberspace. This section should have a good amount of detail but not dive into minute aspects of scripts, hashes, etc. The body of the report provides enough information for the reader to understand the process and the importance of each piece of information contained within. For example, if it is a report about malware that was found on the host, this section would contain what the type of malware is, what it does, what type of systems it affects, and recommended COAs to deal with the malware.
The end of the report is a technical summary (not the same as the executive summary at the beginning).

Offense: This portion should be covered within a classroom discussion regarding an Offensive Mission (CMT).
If vulnerabilities are discovered on a target machine while on an offensive operation, it will provide you with more options for further exploitation and/or implantation with offensive cyber tools. It will also provide insight into the general competency of the administrators of those systems.
Defense: When we attribute this discussion to a Defensive Mission and we are conducting a survey/incident response mission and we notice a Threat Actor presence. This mission will adjust and conduct risk assessment.  After the risk assessment is completed then the mission will change to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
