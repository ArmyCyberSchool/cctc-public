Process States 
The students will research and define the process states

They will understand that one of them will be chosen at random to brief the class on their research findings

Use the random name generator (Script) to choose the briefer

Once the briefer is finished, cover the material below on the process states. Emphasize that wording is not important (ex: new vs. created)

Process States 

New/Created 
Open the file (.exe) 
Create initial thread 
Pass to kernel32.dll to check permissions 
Pass to csrss, build structure, spawns first sub-thread, inserts into windows subsystem-wide proc list
Starts execution of initial thread 
For real-time systems, processes may be held in “New State” to avoid contention
Otherwise, move to “Ready State” automatically
Running
Process currently being executed (one or more threads executing) 
Ready 
Process is ready to execute when given the opportunity (CPU Time) 
Waiting
Process can’t execute until some event occurs (I/O Read) 
Terminated/Exit
Termination of a process due to a halt or abort 


8.2 Explain the process states and identify why they are important

Paging

Memory is allocated to processes in distinct chunks known as “Pages” 

A page is the smallest unit of protection at the hardware level 
4KB for small page, 2MB for large page

When Physical memory (RAM) becomes overcommitted (threads try to use more memory than is available), pages are written to the page file on disk. 

A page fault occurs when a thread references an invalid page. 
If this page is on disk in the page file, it can be brought back into memory. 
Paging

What are Windows Services? 
Long running executable applications that run in their own session 
Can be started automatically at boot, on demand, or when requested 
Can be paused, stopped, or restarted 
Run in the background, normally without a user interface 
Provide a service such as http, ftp, or rdp. 

How do we view service on a machine? 

Sc							#cmd.exe; allows the querying and management of windows services 
Get-service 					#powershell 
WMIC service 					# WMIC 

Examples: 
Sc queryex eventlog 				#info for eventlog service including PID
Tasklist /FI “pid eq XXX” /v 			#query tasklist for PID associated with eventlog 
Tasklist /FI “pid eq XXX” /svc 		#query tasklist for svchost services 
Sc qdescription eventlog 			#query eventlog service description
Sc qc eventlog 					#show the binary command that loads the service

THOUGHT: What if the service is R/W to someone it shouldn’t be? Furthermore, what context do services run as?

Threads
Basic unit to which the OS allocates processor time. 

Can execute any part of the process code 
including parts currently being executed by another thread.

Share memory with each other as well as the process

Deadlock is possible if the threads are waiting for each other’s resources

Synchronization (semaphores, mutexes) are used to control access to shared variables

Csrss maintains a list of threads

Threads are part of a execution priority pool 0-31 per processor, highest executes next


Threads and Handles 
8.3 Explain process threads and handles
</section><section data-background="https://git.cybbh.space/CCTC/public/raw/master/networking/slides/resources/cybbh-skule_header.png" data-background-repeat="none" data-background-position="left top" data-background-size="100%">


Handles
Objects are data structures representing a system resource (file, thread, etc.)

Applications can’t access objects directly, must obtain a handle

Handles for each process are tracked in an internal table known as the Object Manager

Handles allow a common interface to objects, regardless of underlying changes to the object

Handles allow Windows to track ACLs for objects during handle creation time

Research Activity 

Thread States
Have students read sections out of the Windows Processes Book Excerpt under Windows Resources.  Pg 416 and 417 cover thread states.

The students will understand that one of them will be chosen at random to brief the class on the findings of their research

Use the random name generator (Script) to select the briefer

Once the briefer is finished, cover the material below, on the thread states.

The 8 Thread States 

Ready: Waiting for execution, in priority pool

Deferred Ready: Selected to run, but not yet executed. Optimization for scheduling database

Standby: Next thread to run, only one per processor per system

Running: A thread currently running on a processor

Waiting: A period of inactivity while waiting for an event

Transition: Ready for execution, but paging needed to bring stack back into memory

Terminated: Finished execution, heading for deallocation in most cases

Initialized: Thread is being created

Thread States
8.4 Describe the thread states

So what is the difference between processes, threads, and handles?

Process is the primary container (memory structure) for a program being executed.

Threads represent sequential machine-code instructions that a processor executes

Handles are pointers to OS objects referenced within a process

8.5 Discuss the differences between processes, threads and handles

What are system processes? 
Processes owned by, and executed by the operating system.
They are required for the system to function.


What are the 2 types? 

User Mode
Runs in private virtual address space.
Applications are isolated, one crash will not cause another to crash

Kernel Mode
All kernel mode programs run in a single virtual address space
Not isolated from other processes

Ability to run multiple virtual machines off a single set of hardware
VMs can be dynamically created and allocated to users
A single baseline image can be maintained and updated, rather than multiple physical devices
VM instances can be rolled back to undo any changes that take place during a session
Can provide fault tolerance through redundant hardware and migration
could be used as a pivot point
could provide persistence if you can compromise the data store
running from virtual machine lessens attribution
able to spin up whatever OS you need.
Malware analysis
quick restoral times
could create honey pot or tar pit
able to spin up whatever OS you need
harder for malware to maintain persistence

Virtualization - Benefits
11.1 Discuss the importance of virtual machines.

</section><section data-background="https://git.cybbh.space/CCTC/public/raw/master/networking/slides/resources/cybbh-skule_header.png" data-background-repeat="none" data-background-position="left top" data-background-size="100%">

Typically require more upfront planning and configuration
In public cloud environments, lack of granularity in control of data at rest can lead to compliance issues (HIPPA, etc).
Some functions may not work well in a VM, such as copy/paste, printers, netstat, without additional setup effort.
Persistence can be lost if the target machine is restored
could end up in a honey pot or tar pit
If the data store is compromised all new instances will also be compromised
planning and initial setup cost more with virtual networks.

What is situational awareness? 

A method of gaining an understanding of the current operating environment on the target machine.
It applies both defensively and offensively.
Allows you to get an idea of what the system is used for and what type of users use it.
This is what is used to decide what courses of action are appropriate for the system.
