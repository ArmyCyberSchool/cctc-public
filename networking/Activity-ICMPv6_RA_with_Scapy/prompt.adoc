= Activity - ICMPv6 RA with Scapy

== Learning Objectives

* SKILL CCNE002: Network Header fields ¹ ²
** CCNE002.001 Describe security implications present in header fields ²
* SKILL CCNE004: Layer 3 Routing Technologies ¹ ²

== Learning Outcomes

* N/A

== Scenario

* You have control over a Linux client (10.1.0.2) in an IPv4 network. Your target is a Windows 10 client (10.1.0.3) that you have learned has the default, IPv6 enabled on the NIC. Since you are in an IPv4 network, you would like to use IPv6 between yourself and the target to help obfuscate your operation. You will use scapy and leverage IPv6 auto configuration functions to create a means of IPv6 direct communications between the Linux and Windows Machine. 

=== Task 1) 

* Some helpful information:

** First check to make sure your Net1 has a valid ipv6 address by using the "ip addr" or "ifconfig" commands.

* Set your fields a-e. Each field represents the various headers you will be creating. *You can use the show command to verify after setting each value. For example, a.show()* 

* Set your destination in the IPv6 header.
 
 a = IPv6()
 a.dst = "the destination"  (use the multicast address for solicited nodes)

* Set the type of IPv6 traffic (you are sending a Neighbor Discovery/Router Advertisement)

 b = ICMPv6ND_RA()

* Set your source MAC Address (link layer address); 

 c = ICMPv6NDOptSrcLLAddr()
 c.lladdr = "Your LL Address" (This is your MAC address. You should have taken note of this when you checked your ifconfig)

* Set your MTU (use defaults)
 
 d = ICMPv6NDOptMTU()

* Set your Prefix info. Remember you want your Linux machine to be able to speak to the Windows machine.

 e = ICMPv6NDOptPrefixInfo()
 e.prefixlen= 64
 e.prefix= "prefix::" (specify a prefix you would like in hex)

* Go to your Windows 10 client ensure that IPv6 is enabled and then run ipconfig before you send the packet. You should just see a link local ipv6 address.

** Go back to scapy on your Net1 and send your packet!

 send(a/b/c/d/e, iface="eth0")

(the interface could be "eth0" or "eth1" depending on your device. You will need to verify which your device is using)

* Go to your Windows 10 client and run ipconfig after you send the packet. You should see 2 new temporary IPv6 address with the prefix you just specified.

== Deliverables

* Document your steps in Scapy or Scapy script
* Screenshot showing successful communications (pings) between the Linux and Windows Computer on their new IPv6 Network addresses.
