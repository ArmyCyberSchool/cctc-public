= Activity - Practicing Advanced IPTable Rule Creation

== Learning Objectives

* CCNE007.013 - Construct IPTable rules

== Learning Outcomes

* N/A

== Scenario

image::https://git.cybbh.space/CCTC/public/tree/master/networking/additional_resources/Review-Activities/Review-Activity_Images/Practice-Network_Diagram.png

* Utilizing the above network diagram, you will be constructing and placing IPTables rules to meet the intent for filtering on the Linux hosts as specified.

=== Task 

* You will configure rules on H3 the allow for only very specific connections. You will be writing statements tied to different iptables chains.

* All of your IPTables Rules MUST BE ON H3. Combine as many rules as you can. 


=== Conditions to meet on H3 via IPTables rules:

. H3 can recieve and respond to Pings (echo-requests) only if the TTL in the packet is greater than 64

. H3 will change its TTL to 255 when responding to Pings from H1

. H3 can recieve connections on port 1234 from H4

. H3 can recieve SSH connections from Admin

. H3 will REJECT connections on port 1234 from H4 IF sourced from an ephemeral port

. H3 will REJECT connections on port 4444 from H5

. H3 is NOT allowed to source SSH connections TO either IP address on the router

. H3 has a default policy of DROP


== Deliverables

* Document the rules and process you used to construct the IPTables rules.


== Hints

* The "-m" flag is an extension that helps to define matches of a list of more specific criteria, such as "states" and "multiport". Also, keep in mind that certain rules can only be used with specific tables.
