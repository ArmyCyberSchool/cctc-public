= Activity - Practice Writing BPF

== Learning Objectives

* SKILL CCNE005: Identify packet sniffing tools
** CCNE005.001 Explain Berkley Packet Filters (BPF)
** CCNE005.002 Use BPFs to view multiple protocol types
** CCNE005.003 Demonstrate packet decoding features


== Scenario

* Berkley Packet Filters (BPF). You will need to be familiar with using BPFâ€™s to capture and analyze traffic on target systems that is more focused than what standard TCPDump expressions can provide. 

** Create the following filters using BPFs with protocol, byte offset, mask (if necessary) and condition.
** Do NOT use TCPdump expressions
** Do NOT use BPF primitives


=== Task 1)

. Capture all packets with a TTL of 128 or less for both IPv4 and IPv6

. Capture all inital ip traceroute traffic using icmp and UDP

. Capture all ip traffic with the DF bit set

. Capture all packets with the MF flag set and Fragmentation offset result of 31744 / 8

. Capture all TCP packets with a destination port equal to or less than 1024

. Capture all/only IPv4 packets 

. Capture all ipv4 telnet and SSH traffic

. Capture all TCP packets with only the URG/PUSH/FIN flags set

. Capture all traffic that contains a VLAN ID of 100

. Capture all traffic that has an IPv4 address of 192.168.36.10

. Capture all traffic that has a DSCP of 38

. Capture all DNS zone transers

. Capture all ARP traffic

. Capture all IPv6 next header traffic of EIGRP
