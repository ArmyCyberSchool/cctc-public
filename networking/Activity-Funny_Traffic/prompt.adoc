= Activity - Funny Traffic

== Learning Objectives

* CCNE009 - Identify packet sniffing tools
** CCNE009.003 - Demonstrate packet decoding features of tools

== Learning Outcomes

* N/A

== Scenario

* Your team has been conducting traffic analysis for a network which was compromised. The team has asked you to look at (3) samples that stood out as anomalies.
* You can find the PCAP resources in the networking folder of the resource server at:
** https://git.cybbh.space/CCTC/public/raw/master/networking/additional_resources/AreyouGettingthis.pcap
** https://git.cybbh.space/CCTC/public/raw/master/networking/additional_resources/SANTA.pcap

=== Task 1)

* Based on the raw data for sample 1, or PCAPs provided for Samples 2-3, answer the following questions about the nature/details of the traffic you are analyzing.

. What is anomalous about this traffic? 
. How could traffic like this be used in an exploit situation?
. Is this something you can defend against?  If so, how?

* Sample 1- See the "SANTA.pcapng" file
* Sample 2 (these two packets are related, consider how they are related)

* Packet 1:

* Sample 3- See the "Are your getting this.pcap" file
** (hint- follow the tcp stream starting at the HTTP Get request, packet 4)

== Deliverables

* Complete answers to the above questions for traffic samples 1-3.
