= Activity - Extracting Files

== Learning Objectives

* CCNE009 - Identify packet sniffing tools
** CCNE009.003 - Demonstrate packet decoding features of tools

== Learning Outcomes

* N/A

== Scenario

* Wireshark makes exporting objects from some protocols very easy (HTTP for example), however there are no built-in features for exporting many other protocols. Specifically, protocols like FTP must be manually extracted.
* Download and use the following PCAPs for the activity:
** https://git.cybbh.space/CCTC/public/raw/master/networking/additional_resources/PCAPS/FTP-file-extract.pcapng
** https://git.cybbh.space/CCTC/public/raw/master/networking/additional_resources/PCAPS/HTTP-file-extract.pcapng

=== Task 1)

* Using the "FTP-file-extract" and "HTTP-file-extract" PCAPs, practice file extraction.
* Extract a single image from the FTP PCAP (pantheon.jpg)
* You will find MANY image files within the HTTP PCAP; choose the image of your choice, but be sure to note the packet number that it was derived from.

== Deliverables

* Your images, as extracted from the PCAPS
