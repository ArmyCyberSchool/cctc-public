== Scenario

* You have control over a Linux client in a network (net1-10.1.0.2). Your target is a Windows 10 client (net2-10.1.0.3) in your IPv4 network. You will use scapy and leverage ARP functions to manually "discover" the host. ARP is an important protocol in host discovery. The reason behind this is that ARP is necessary for normal communications, whereas often ICMP may be blocked by a host's firewall (Windows firewall blocks ping by default...so ICMP alone would not "see" a Windows client)

=== Task 1) 

* STEP 1: In Linux, as root, turn on ARP_ACCEPT for all interfaces:

 cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_accept
 
It sould be set to "0" by default. We want to change to "1".

 echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_accept
 
You can verify this by:

 cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/arp_accept
 
Should now be set to "1" for enabled. If it is "0", then it is still disabled.

* STEP 2: Check your Linux Host's ARP table. If an entry exists for your target (10.1.0.3) then delete the entry. As long as you don't initiate communications with the host, the ARP table should stay clear of the host's information.

 arp -d 10.1.0.3
 or
 ip -s neigh flush all
 
** You will see an "incomplete" entry for the host(s) after deleting any existing ARP entries when using the arp command. This is the state that the entry takes if there has ever been an ARP request sent (since uptime) but the ARP reply information is not available. In this case, if there was an ARP entry that you deleted/flushed, the state (having previously sent an ARP request) is still true; you are only flushing the reply information.

* STEP 3: Now to craft your request:

** Type "Scapy" in the terminal of your net1 Linux machine

** You will need to set your fields for a and b. These fields relate to your Ether Header and ARP headers.

*** Ether Header: 

 a=Ether()
 a.show() *this will show you what the variable now has for defaults*
 a.src= "Your MAC Address"
 a.dst= "ARP requests are broadcast"
 a.type= The hex code for ARP

*** ARP Header:

 b=ARP()
 b.op= opcode for requests
 b.hwsrc= "Your MAC"
 b.psrc= "Your IP"
 b.pdst= "Target IP"


* *START UP WIRESHARK AND WATCH THE WIRE WHILE YOU SEND THE PACKET!*

* Send the packet using:

 sendp(a/b, iface="eth0" )

(the interface could be "eth0" or "eth1" depending on your device. You will need to verify which your device is using)

== Deliverables

* Document your steps in Scapy or Scapy script
* Screenshot the ARP table showing a successful ARP entry in response to your crafted packet

== Hints

* N/A

== Challenge

* Choose 1
** Create a script to send ARP packets to an entire subnet range, to automate the host discovery process
** Try crafting packets to poison the ARP table/cache in the Windows client (insert bogus information)
