= Exercise - Follow a Packet Through a Network

== Learning Objectives

* SKILL CCNE001: Networking Fundamentals
* SKILL CCNE002: Network Header fields
* SKILL CCNE003: Layer 2 Switching Technologies
* SKILL CCNE004: Layer 3 Routing Technologies

== Learning Outcomes

* N/A

== Scenario

* The network provided is a fully functioning network with many different protocols working to function.

* Router login usernames will be "cctc"

* All device passwords for this Exercise is "password"


=== Setup)


. Download the CCTC.pkt file.

** Download: https://git.cybbh.space/CCTC/public/raw/electric-boogaloo/networking/Exercise-Follow_a_packet_through_a_network/CCTC.pkt on to your Net1. 

** Optionally you can download to your host box and use SCP to copy to Net1. "scp /home/username/Downloads/CCTC.pkt username@{net1 floating ip} /home/username".

. Startup Packet Tracer on Net1. 

** Open Net 1 on the VTA, open a Terminal Window and type "packettracer".

** Optionally you can run Packet Tracer on your host box from Net1: "ssh username@{net1 floatingip} -X" then run "packettracer".

** Another option is to connect to your Net1 with xfreerdp. "xfreerdp /v:{net1 floating ip}  /u:username /p:password /size:1920x1000  + clipboard"

. Upon startup, you will be asked for login credentials (which you will not have). Click the "Guest Login" at the bottom. After 10-15 seconds you can click "Confirm Guest" to open the program. A webpage will open but you can close this window.

. From Packet Tracer, open the CCTC.pkt file that you downloaded. 

. Upon opening, the virtual systems will boot up and start communicating. Give it a few moments for the Bootup, Spanning-tree, and DHCP to complete.

. During this Exercise:

*** You can switch between "Realtime" and "Simulation" by clicking the icons in the bottom right corner on the window. You will be navigating between these modes for this Activity. 

*** You will be required to select appropriate protocols under the "Event List Filters - Visible Events" window in the "Simulation" tab or each of the steps. To select the appropriate protocol select "Edit Filters". Would not recommend having additional protocols selected as this will populate a lot of extra information.

*** To start a packet capture, ensure you are in "Simulation" and have edited the filter for the proper protocol(s). After you perform an action, you can capture 1 packet at a time by using the "Capture/Forward" or "Back" to move forward and backward. To start capturing all packets you can select "Auto Capture/Play" in the "Play Controls" window.

*** In the "Event List" window you will see your packet captures. Click them to view the packet contents. On some events, you will see "Inbound" and "Outbound" tabs to identify the direction of traffic.

*** You can click to open any of the items on the network. The tab you will generally be using is the "Desktop" tab. On the Routers and Switches, you will use the "CLI" tab.


=== Task 1)
