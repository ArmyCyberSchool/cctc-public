== Credentials

Description:Username:Password
Telnet (Jose):studentxx:passwordxx

Tunnel (No Terminal):tunnel:password

Student (Terminal Access):studentxx:passwordxx
:===

Note: When utilizing the "tunnel" user credentials, you must specify a "-NT" at the end of your command, otherwise it will not work.

== Scenario

You are provided with information about your target network that indicates a specific host in the target network is set up with extremely strict inbound rules; the outbound rules are more flexible however. 
Since you canâ€™t get any packets IN to it, you must focus on getting packets OUT. You have an insider, Jose, that you have convinced to set up remote port forwarding on the target host. This will allow you to gain access to the sensitive information hosted on it's web server. 

* You will need to "play" the role of Jose initially and telnet to the floating IP provided by your instructor (10.50.X.X).

== Activity

Using remote port forwarding, Jose needs to establish a tunnel outbound from the host he has access to and forward its webpage (or anything other services you decided to specify) to a specific port on a host that you can access from your network (Atropia Pivot). This provides you with the ability to connect from the outside network (using local port forwarding) to the port specified on the Atropia pivot (90XX) and receive the webpage (or whatever else is available) hosted from the target host.

=== Task 1)
*Perform the actions our insider, Jose, would take in order to make this possible:*

1.) Acting as the "insider", Jose, access the target host via telnet (utilize the "student" SSH credentials). 

2.) Set up a remote port forward to 90XX at the Atropia pivot on the target host in order to host it's webpage. (Utilize the "tunnel" SSH credentials)


{empty} +

=== Task 2)
*As the malicious external actor, connect to the service our insider Jose has hosted for us:*

1.) After Jose establishes the reverse tunnel, you should return to your home machine (H1). You will need to create a local port forward in order to tunnel through the compromised SSH Server (Atropia), at 10.50.X.X. (Utilize the the "tunnel" user credentials)

2.) Your SSH tunnels should connect a local port on your H1 host (port of your choosing, 1111 for example) to the port (90XX) on the compromised pivot host (Atropia) that Jose is sending the webpage to via the remote tunnel created in task 1.

3.) Once complete, you should be able to access the target host's webpage from the browser on your H1 client at the local port you chose in step 2 of task 2.

4.) Clear your browser cache.

=== Task 3)

*Utilize the diagram below for Task 3:*

*As the malicious external actor, you need to discover and interact with other services to obtain additional information:* 

1.) Our insider, Jose, has discovered his host can reach various services on other hosts within the 10.2.0.0/25 network. 

* You will need to "play" the role of Jose once again. Telnet to the floating IP provided by your instructor (10.50.X.X). Then, change the tunnel commands for the appropriate service being accessed (SSH, FTP, HTTP, etc..)

2.) Scan the network and interact with services of interest from your H1 host in your home environment utilizing remote and dynamic port forwarding to obtain the files.

* Dynamic port forwarding will use proxychains, by default proxychains is setup to utilize port 9050 on your H1 host. This must be specified in your tunnel commands in order to work properly.
