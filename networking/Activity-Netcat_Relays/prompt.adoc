= Activity - Netcat Relays

== Learning Objectives

* CCNE008.005 - Explain the forward and reverse file transfer process with netcat
* CCNE008.006 - Demonstrate the process for transferring files via terminal

== Learning Outcomes

* N/A

== Scenario

* You will be transferring files between H1 and the DMZ client using the H3 client as a relay.

=== Task 1) 

* Send secrectstuff.txt from H1 to the DMZ Client. H3 will be the relay. You *CANNOT* make *outbound* connections on H3.
** Create a file named "secretstuff.txt" on the H1 host. Write the message "This is important information" into the file. You will be sending this to the DMZ host through a relay at H3.
** For the transfer of "secretstuff", H3 cannot make outbound connections.

=== Task 2) 

* Send supersecrectstuff.txt from H1 to the DMZ Client. H3 will be the relay. You can *ONLY* make *outbound* connections on H3.
** Create a file on the H1 client named "supersecretstuff.txt" and write the message "passwords should be complex" into the file. You will be sending this to the DMZ client through a relay on H3.
** For the transfer of "supersecretstuff", H3 can only make outbound connections.

=== Task 3) 

* Send secrectsquirrelstuff.txt from H1 to the DMZ Client. H3 will be the relay. You can *ONLY* make *outbound* connections on H1, and you can *ONLY* make *inbound* connections on the DMZ client.
** Create a file on the H1 client named "secretsquirrelstuff.txt" and write the message "awww nuts" into the file. You will be sending this to the DMZ client through a relay on H3.
** For the transfer of "secretsquirrelstuff", the relay for H3 should be configured to ensure the H1 is making an *outbound* connection, while the DMZ Client is making an *inbound* connection.
