== Outcomes

[square]
* Familiarity with key Linux files: `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/group`
* Familiarity with Linux command line text editors
* Understanding of group membership and its effects on file access
* Confidence querying and editing password attributes for groups and users

== Scenario

You are on an OCO mission; through your movement behind enemy lines, you gained access to a system whose authentication security was fairly weak. You have limited privileges on the system, and wish to escalate your privileges.

== Activity

=== Task 1)

[square]
* Copy your `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` and `/etc/group` files to a backup directory.
* As a user in the sudoers group, add a user 'ken' to the system
* Using a text editor, edit user ken in `/etc/passwd` for the following:
** GID (Group ID) '0'
** 'bash' shell
** home directory of `/home/ken`
** password attribute to 'not required'
** full name of 'Maintenance Account'
** account set to expire on 1 Jan 2020
** next password change for 30 days from now
** password change warning of 10 days
* Check to ensure that these changes have taken effect from via the command line

=== Task 2)

[square]
* Switch to the new user 'ken'
* Type `id`
* Are you in the root GID?
* Still as user 'ken', type `cat /etc/shadow`
* Why are you not able to view the shadow file?
* Hint: `ls -al /ect/shadow`
* Identify which groups user 'ken' belongs to; is user 'ken' in more than one group?
* How many groups is user 'dachosen1' in?

=== Task 3)

[square]
* Type `exit` to switch back to your sudoer user account
* Using a text editor, add user 'ken' to the group with write access to the `/etc/shadow` file
* switch back to user 'ken'
* Type `cat /etc/shadow`
* Were you able to open the file this time?

== Deliverables

[square]
* Verification of kenâ€™s ability to read `/etc/shadow`
* Correct contents of `/etc/shadow`
