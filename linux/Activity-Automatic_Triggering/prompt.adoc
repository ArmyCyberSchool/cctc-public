== Learning Objectives

[square]
* CCNI006  - Identify Linux processes
** CCNI006.003  - Employ commands to enumerate processes
** CCNI006.004  - Explain the functionality of daemons
* CCNI011  - Discuss the reasons to establish permanent presence
** CCNI011.001  - Define permanent presence

== Learning Outcomes

[square]
* Confidence using Linux scheduled tasks (cronjobs)
* Familiarity with Linux Daemon startup & functionality
* Familiarity with Bash conditional operations
* Confidence writing Bash scripts to achieve specific objectives

== Scenario

System admins have began to notice malicious traffic from thier client systems.  In an effort to thwart any non-recognized communications, the system admins are inadvertently killing processes, including your monitoring process.

== Activity

* Write a persistence script that checks if your monitoring script (from previous activity) is running.
** If the monitoring script does not exist, the persistence script should create it.
** If the monitoring script is running, the persistence script should wait "x" min, and check again. 
** If the monitoring script is not running, the persistence script should launch the monitoring script.

* Write a deployment script that applies Linux functionality to ensure the persistence script is executed when the system is launched/rebooted.
** Test your script on your system to ensure that the monitoring script can properly recover from reboots and having its process killed.
** If your persistence script exists, your deployment script should exit, however if your persistence script does not exist, your deployment script should generate it.

== Deliverables

[square]
