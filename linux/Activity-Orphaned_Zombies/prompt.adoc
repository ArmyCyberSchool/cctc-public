== Learning Objectives

* CCNI006       - Identify Linux processes
** CCNI006.003   - Employ commands to enumerate processes
** CCNI006.005   - Discuss orphaned and defunct processes
** CCNI006.007   - Evaluate the validity of Linux processes
* CCNI007   - Develop shell scripts
** CCNI007.001   - Demonstrate basic familiarity with shell scripting
** CCNI007.002   - Explain variables and variable manipulation
** CCNI007.003   - Employ commands for string manipulation

== Learning Outcomes

* Familiarity with linux processes and process management
* Familiarity with ps binary
* Confidence spawning and manipulating processes 

== Scenario

* You need to create some abnormal process behavior on a target system to consume resources and alert admins of "suspicious" activity.

=== Task 1)

* Three Orphaned Zombies:
** Write a script that creates three zombie / defunct processes that are orphaned.
** Your orphaned zombies should only exist temporarily for 30 seconds and should automatically resove themselves after that time period.
** Ensure the defunct process are orphaned and adopted by init.
** Identify the orphaned zombies in a process list output.
* What is the danger of having many zombie processes running at one time?

== Deliverables

* Your script that creates the three orphanded zombies

== Hints

* Zombie: `sleep 1 & exec sleep 60`
* Orphan: `(sleep 60 &)`
