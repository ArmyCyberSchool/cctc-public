* Using msfvenom, generate two custom payloads, 1 for a Window XP system, and 1 for a Windows 7 system. The Windows XP payload needs to callback to the attacking machine and re-connect at reboot; the Windows 7 payload needs to callback to the attacking machine only when triggered by a user (get creative: replace IExplore icon, utilman.exe, or calc.exe, etc.).
* Be sure your exploits are gaining SYSTEM level access.
