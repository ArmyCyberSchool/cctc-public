== Scenario

You are operating on a system that your team has previously gained access to.  Using only the SAMBA protocol, you need to exfil the SYSTEMINFO off the target Windows system.

== Activity

[square]
* Write a bash script that achieves the following objectives:
** creates a shared directory named `/cctcsmb`  with read, write, and execute permissions for Owner, Group and Others
** adds a new Samba user named `samcctc`
** creates a group called `smbusers`
** adds `samcctc` to this new group
** gives `samcctc` ownership of the `/cctcsmb` directory
** configure `smb.conf`  file so that it allows guest access, is not read only, and can also be browsed
* have your script output:
** the settings of ONLY the permissions settings for the files and/or groups, directories you altered. 

{empty} +
 
* non-scripted:
** Connect to the SAMBA Server you setup via a Windows system using user `samcctc`
** exfiltrate the SYSTEMINFO, via SAMBA, from the Windows target
