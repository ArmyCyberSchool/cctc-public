== Scenario

You've been tasked to generate a non-netcat socket that allows you to connect to your SSH server.  In order to understand how the target might detect your activities, you need to fully understand how  /dev/tcp  operates, and what, if any, artifacts it generates on the target system. 

== Exercise

Write a bash script that uses Linux /dev/tcp  to allow you to connect to the SSH server on your localhost.  Utilize the exec command to open a file descriptor attached to the /dev/tcp socket.

Finally, find the directory where the newly-spawned file descriptor is located on your machine, and get the file descriptor's octal permissions value (file: pipe[random #s] )

Hint: how can you see a newly-spawned ssh service?
