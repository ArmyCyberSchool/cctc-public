* CCNI013       - Explore Linux Exploitation tools
** CCNI013.003   - Define credentials
** CCNI013.004   - Perform credential cracking

== Learning Outcomes

* Familiarity with hash types, password crackers and their syntax and application
* Confidence with credential cracking

=== Task 1)

* Run a dictionary attack
** using the windows hashes you captured from the previous activity, and a wordlist of your choice, from `/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/` 
*** unshadow the passwords of the provided 3TC_PA55W0RD, and 3TC_5HAD0W files, in `/usr/share/class/PassCrack.zip`
*** reveal the passwords using JTR, and a wordlist from seclists

== Deliverables

* cracked user shadowed passwords 

== Challenge

* visit the website associated with the target System: http://127.0.0.1/warriors/
** determine some key details about the author of the website
*** devise a new wordlist using tools: Cewl and JTR Config Generator
*** target the un-cracked hash for the website author (Dan), and using the newly generated worldist, and JTR, reveal the author's password
