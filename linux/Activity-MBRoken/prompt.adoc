== Learning Objectives

* CCNI004 - Describe the Linux boot process
** CCNI004.001 - Identify components of the boot process
** CCNI004.004 - Describe partitions

== Learning Outcomes

* Familiarity with the parts of a correctly formatted Linux MBR
* Ability to analyze an MBR using CLI binaries and identify misconfigurations.

== Scenario

* The hard drive in your Commander's laptop, containing critical files, stopped responding after a network-wide malware attack. You're fairly certain the problem has something to do with the HD's MBR (file: "mbroken").

== Task 1)

* You have access to a baseline MBR (mbrgood.zip), as well as the bad MBR (mbroken.zip)
** The files are located here: `/usr/share/class/`
* Start by verifying that you have the correct boot record file. 
** Unzip the file `mbroken.zip` and check its MD5 hash: `b73f30cf162511fe8429ff907a5a9f53`
* Using Linux binaries:
** MD5 hash the bootstrap/bootloader code.
** MD5 hash the second partition entry code.
** Figure out what's still wrong with the MBR. Find the hex characters (ALL CAPS, no spaces).
*** NOTE: You are looking for a string of hex characters (i.e. "DEADBEEF").

== Deliverables

* Check your work:  `$ CMD... | md5sum`
** Bootstrap code:   `d59a68c7b6d62ecaa1376dfb73a3b7be`
** Second partition: `41a8cbc4d7314c23c7e7f6b0a799d76b`
** Hex string:       `d7c07574567e1af6856be94a590ec2dc`

== Hints

* `dd`, `hexdump`
* Read up on the specs for a properly formated MBR
* Your endian may be off

== Challenge

* N/A
