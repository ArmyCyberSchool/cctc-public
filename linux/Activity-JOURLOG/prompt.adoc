Requirements: linux system with SYSTEMD installed

=== Task 1)

Write a script that utilizes journalctl to evaluate the kernelâ€™s error and warning messages twice on your system, at 30 sec intervals, uses `diff` to compare the two output files, and output the results to a file located in `/usr/share/cctc/`.  

=== Task 2)

Utilize journalctl to display the last 10 logs entries associated with the cron service, ever generated, and the last 15 log entries associated with your UID that generated in the last hour, and output all the results one file located in `/usr/share/cctc/` in addition to displaying the results to screen.
