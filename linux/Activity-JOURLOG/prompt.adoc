== Learning Objectives

* CCNI009 - Identify auditing activities
** CCNI009.001 - Explain system logging
** CCNI009.002 - Identify application logging
* CCNI010 - Identify actions that contribute to log files
** CCNI010.001 Describe the actions that contribute to entries in log files
** CCNI010.002 Analyze log files for anomalous activity


== Learninig Outcomes

* Understanding capabilities of systemd journalctl tool
* Deployment of journalctl in a Linux infrastructure

== Scenario

* Requirements: linux system with systemd installed
* check: `ls -al /sbin/init` +

=== Task 1)

* Write a script that utilizes journalctl to evaluate kernel messages .. Have your script:
** dump kernel error and warning messages only, at 30 second intervals.
** terminate after two iterations of message dumps have been reached.
** use `diff` in your script, to compare the two output dump files.  
** display the last 10 logs entries associated with the cron service, ever generated.
** display the last 15 log entries associated with your UID that generated in the last hour.
** in addition to displaying the results to screen, have them also output to a file in `/usr/share/cctc`

== Deliverables

* your script
* a file in `/usr/share/cctc` containing all of the results


== Hints

* `man tee | grep -A1 DESCRIPTION`
