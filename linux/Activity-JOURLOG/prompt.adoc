=== Task 2)

Utilize journalctl to display the last 10 logs entries associated with the cronservice, ever generated, and the last 15 log entries associated with your UID  that generated in the last hour, and output all the results one file located in /usr/share/cctc/ in addition to displaying the results to screen.
