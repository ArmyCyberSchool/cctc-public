** CCNI003.003 - Discuss file system permissions
** CCNI003.005 - Discuss file system attributes

{empty} +

== Outcomes

[square]
* Familiarity with Linux file permissions
* Familiarity with Linux access control lists (ACLs)
* Familiarity editing and applying permissions and ACLS to users and groups

{empty} +

== Scenario

_Welcome to the Galactic Empire Messaging System!_ One of our servers recently failed and we are in the process of rebuilding our message board. We managed to salvage all the messages, which are just a series of plaintext files kept in a flat directory structure. Furthermore, we know who our users were but we need to recreate all of their accounts and reset file permissions identical to the way they were, _lest we incur the Emperor's wrath._

== Activity

* Given the attributes below:
** recreate the users, groups, and messages/files below
** assign applicable permissions, ACLs, and attributes for each

----
rebels_only           is owned by leia, & the rebels, is rwx-able by the owner, and all rebels but no one else.

imps_only		      is owned by palpatine, and the imps, is rwx-able by the owner, rx-able by all imps, and has no further permissions.

                      Hint: Should 'everyone else' include the group?
