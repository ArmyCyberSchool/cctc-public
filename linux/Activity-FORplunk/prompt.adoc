Sort these files in a directory structure that consists of 1 parent directory called "SORTED", and 5 child directories, named: ALPHA, NUM, PDF, PNG, TXT.

"./SORTED/"

|---ALPHA

|---NUM

|---PDF

|---PNG

|---TXT

Then, sort the 6 files from the 10.200.10.10/downloads/linux-files/sorted.zip file according to the following criteria:
Files that start with a letter go in the ALPHA Folder; files that start with a number go in the NUM folder, and .pdf extension files in the PDF folder, .png extension files in the PNG folder and .txt extension files in the TXT folder.

Tip:  run the following CMD to check the output of your script:

$ tree -L 2 ./SORTED

5 directories, 12 files

Hint: grep, for loop
