== Activity

=== Task 1)

* Create a script that audits the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files.
** Make sure your script triggers on any read, write, execute, or attribute changes.
** Have your script output the new audit rules your script sets.  
** Keep in mind that the audit process you establish will be tested by whether or not it captures the traffic you input as you manipulate files on your VM.
* Have your script:
** add a new group named `cctc_audit`
** create a new user called `cctc_auser`
** add user `cctc_auser` to group `cctc_audit`
** set a password for `cctc_auser`.

=== Task 2)
* Regain access to the audits you set up earlier in the exercise and review what traffic they captured manually using color grep , and using `ausearch` tool.
