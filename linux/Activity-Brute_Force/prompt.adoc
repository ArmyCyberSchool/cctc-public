image::../Resources/brute.png[HYDRA,height="150",width="350",float="left"]

== Learning Objectives

* CCNI013       - Explore Linux Exploitation tools
** CCNI013.003   - Define credentials

== Learning Outcomes

* Familiarity with "common creds" service attacks
* Usage of Hydra to defeat IDS/IPS detection

== Scenario

* N/A

=== Task 1)

* Using what you've learned about Hydra, attempt to brute force the SMB service password:
** create a colon delimited username:password file, or seperate user and password lists, to be used with Hydra.
** check the SMB service status on the target system using Netcat, Nmap, Metasploit, etc.; verify SMB is listening.
** begin brute force attack...reveal additional services vulnerable to common-cred attacks

== Deliverables

* N/A

== Hints

* Right-Click in FireFox and select 'Inspect Element'
