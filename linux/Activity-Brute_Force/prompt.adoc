== Learning Objectives

* CCNI013       - Explore Linux Exploitation tools
** CCNI013.003   - Define credentials

{empty} +

== Learning Outcomes

[square]
* Familiarity with "common creds" service attacks
* Usage of Hydra to defeat IDS/IPS detection

{empty} +

== Activity

* Using what you've learned about Hydra, attempt to brute force the SMB service password:
** create a colon delimited username:password file, or seperate user and password lists, to be used with Hydra.
** check the SMB service status on the target system using Netcat, Nmap, Metasploit, etc.; verify SMB is listening.
** begin brute force attack...reveal additional services vulnerable to common-cred attacks
