== Activity

Using what you've learned about Hydra, attempt to brute force the SMB service password:

Step 1: create a colon delimited username:password file, or seperate user and pass lists, to be used with Hydra.

Step 2: check the SMB service status on the target WIN7 system using netcat; verify SMB is listening.

Step 3: begin brute force attack...reveal user(s) passwords
