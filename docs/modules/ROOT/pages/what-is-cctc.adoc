= What is CCTC?

CCTC is the course that ensures that all 17-series Soldiers,
regardless of rank or position,
have the minimum acceptable amount of technical knowledge required to be successful in this space.
It is designed to focus on computer science,
electrical engineering,
mathematics,
and the other related fields necessary for Cyberspace Operations to be successful.

It is *not* designed to teach tools or techniques - those items are left to OJT since they are highly unit and situation specific.
